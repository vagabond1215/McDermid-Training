      <summary>Module 1 – Basic Support Instructions</summary>
      <p>Module 1 begins your training for the Veteran’s Division. Each chapter includes multiple subsections that support the tasks for that chapter. Chapters 1 through 5 typically take about an hour each, while Chapter 6 usually requires two to four hours. Once your Chapter 6 video is approved, you will move on to Module A to complete the No‑Cost Benefits presentation. You have two days to complete Module 1.</p>

      <h3>Rule of Thumb</h3>

        <summary>Chapter 1 – Welcome</summary>
        <p>Welcome and congratulations! You are embarking on a career where your results mirror your effort. We expect you to work as diligently as we do. Training covers three key areas: Production, Resources, and Quality. Listen to your trainers, ask questions, stay positive, and follow the schedule to ensure success.</p>
        <h4>Training Expectations</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Learn the complete presentation—starting with Section A—by the end of your first week so you can present while in training and begin earning income.</li>
          <li>Collect at least five referrals per household.</li>
          <li>Book at least one referral during every virtual meeting.</li>
          <li>Complete training on time and be prepared for your release meeting.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Tasks</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Complete the 1a Financial Analysis.</strong> Begin now so you can record recurring expenses you might overlook, such as haircuts. Exact amounts are not required; we will use your approximate monthly income requirement to build a reverse budget and determine the activity needed to reach your goals.
            <button id="begin-financial-analysis" type="button">Begin Financial Analysis</button>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Add an alarm for the Professional Growth and Personal Development meeting.</strong> This meeting occurs every Friday at 11:00 a.m. Pacific. Set a reminder for 10 minutes beforehand and add it to your work calendar as a weekly recurring event.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Expectations</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>I understand that I must memorize and recite the script to qualify for field training.</li>
          <li>I understand that I must integrate required forms into the presentation seamlessly using available technology.</li>
          <li>I understand that I must set appointments that result in actual meetings.</li>
          <li>I understand that field training is scheduled alongside my manager’s availability. If I cannot work my manager’s schedule, training may be delayed and I may not meet with clients or produce business.</li>
          <li>I understand that without qualifying for field training I cannot meet with clients and a manager will not produce business for or with me.</li>
          <li>I understand that completing field training allows me to work my own schedule, meet with my own clients, and produce business independently.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Final Task</h4>
        <p>Send an email to <a href="mailto:ahayes@ailpdx.com">Autumn</a> and <a href="mailto:mjohnson@ailpdx.com">Michelle</a> and cc <a href="mailto:barb@ailpdx.com">Barb</a>.<br />
        <strong>Subject:</strong> [Your Full Name] – Chapter 1<br />
        Confirm that you printed the financial analysis sheet, set alarms for both weekly meetings, added them to your work calendar as recurring events, and understand the expectations above.</p>
